Why are there two Devpacs?

************************
BUG in devpac3.18-editor
************************


see picture devpac318bug_workaround.jpg


Editor Devpac3.18 loads:
Devpac.prefs - the settings the editor uses.
GenAm.opts   - the options used when calling the assembler.

The last file can not be saved anymore.
But Devpac304 can!

When you changes assembler options in devpac318 that works fine.
But they are lost when you quit.

If you run devpac304 you can change and save these.
Or you can edit the file and change it.


if you add relative folders with the selector
to the include list: put '/' before its path.
