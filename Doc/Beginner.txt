Beginners:
----------

src/plot_pixel.s is a text_file that can be viewed.
It can be converted to a program_file.
In the debugger we can see what every instruction does.

You can later add/change to see what happens.
Lets see what it does.



Lets do it:
-----------
Click devpac or start

Menu: Project/Load          a text-file
 Src/plot_pixel.s

Menu: Program/Assemble      makes program-file from text-file
 window assembling

Menu: Program/Debug         starts monam with that program-file
 Follow the instructions in window4.
 <amiga>Q Quits.




More:
-----

Try:
 joy_sep.s  a short one
 float.s    FPU
 attnflag.s use os-calls, but has no walktrough
in examples map is more

 afloat.s
 snippets.s
Give errors in devpac because they use 080 instructions.



68080:
------
For 080 instructions we have to take a different way.

-Make the Devpac/Src folder the active one.
-type: <amiga>E CLI

type: execute afloat_script  (Assemble using VASM)
 a file is created and given to the debugger.
 or when there are errors the text shows where to find them.



Help:
-----
Having a printed "Debug Command Summary.txt" could be helpfull.
