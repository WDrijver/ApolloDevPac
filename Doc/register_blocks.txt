MonAm 3.09
Configurable blocks of the new register type (080 only)
-------------------------------------------------------


Simple Change
-------------

<amiga>C hange when using Monam.
 possible:
 da Data+Addr
 fb Float+B-addr
 e3 3 coloms of 8 rows
 e3f same as e3 but only in float 9 decimals.
 f6/9/12 float with 6/9/12 fraction decimals.
 e6/9/12 same for extra registers.
 a  Addr
 b  B-addr
 c  Control registers (not yet)
 d  Data
 e  Extra
 es Extra small, only 8 of the posible 24 are shown.
 f  same as f12.
 ff full float, 4 coloms of 8 rows fp & e in 9 decimals.
 m  Monam-addr see page 153
 m0 m0 float: addr looked at as single, double & extended
 pc status of integer unit and float unit, progam counter and next
    instruction.
 pc2 status+stack pointer & pc+next instruction
 pc3 status fp & pc2
 pc4 pc2 & status fp+m0 float
 space between entries, double space to indicate a bottom-part.



Complex Change
--------------

The monam pref file can hold 30 blocks that define the 080-register window
layout. It starts at byte 100 with '[' and ends with ']' and contains 98bytes.

Between that is the structure:

-top entries:  entrie (3bytes), entrie (3bytes), .. 
-0(1byte) to indicate end_top_list
-bottom entries:  entrie (3bytes), .. 
-0(1byte) to indicate end

The entries do not have to be there, the 2 end indicators do.

An entrie (block) contains 3 bytes:
1/ Number of lines. may not be zero. (msb signals place empty line before)
2/ Start line
3/ Routine

There is no check if it is correct, just intended for the expert that wants
a more complex presentation.


current asignment:

routine_0 intended routine for the bottomline.
curently only holds 1 line:
status integer unit, status float unit, program counter with next instruction.

Block examples:
---------------

$18 00 0e = 24,0,14  24 lines( no empty line), start with 0, E-reg with 12 decimal
$86 02 11 =134,2,17   6 lines(add emtpy line), start with 2, M-reg
$01 00 00 =  1,0, 0   1 line ( no empty line), start with 0, PC
